_NumPy 프로젝트와 커뮤니티에 대한 몇가지 정보_

NumPy는 Python에서 Numerical Computing을 할 수 있도록 도와주는 오픈소스 프로젝트입니다. Numerical와 Numarray라는 라이브러리의 초기 작업을 기반으로 2005년에 만들어졌습니다. NumPy는 항상 100% 오픈소스 소프트웨어 일것이며, [수정된 BSD 라이센스](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)에 따라서 누구나 무료로 사용하고 배포할 수 있습니디.

NumPy는 광범위한 Scientific Python 커뮤니티의 협의를 통해 GitHub에서 공개적으로 개발되었습니다. 우리의 거버넌스 접근 방식에 대한 더 자세한 내용은 [거버넌스 문서](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html)를 참조해 주세요.
